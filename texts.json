["LLM Powered Autonomous Agents\n    \nDate: June 23, 2023  |  Estimated Reading Time: 31 min  |  Author: Lilian Weng\n\n\nBuilding agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\nAgent System Overview#\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent\u2019s brain, complemented by several key components:\n\nPlanning\n\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\n\n\nMemory", "Memory\n\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\n\n\nTool use\n\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.", "Fig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\nComponent One: Planning#\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\nTask Decomposition#\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to \u201cthink step by step\u201d to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model\u2019s thinking process.", "Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.", "Another quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into \u201cProblem PDDL\u201d, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing \u201cDomain PDDL\u201d, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\nSelf-Reflection#\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.", "ReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\nObservation: ...\n... (Repeated many times)", "Fig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: \u2026 step is removed.\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.", "Fig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent\u2019s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.", "Fig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)", "Chain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\geq r_{n-1} \\geq \\dots \\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\leq i \\leq j \\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.", "To avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.", "Fig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.", "Fig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.", "In comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.", "Fig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\nComponent Two: Memory#\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I\u2019ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\nTypes of Memory#\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\n\n\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).", "Short-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\n\n\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\n\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\n\n\n\n\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:", "Fig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\n\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.", "Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:", "LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.", "HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. \u201csix degrees of separation\u201d feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can\u2019t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.", "FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\langle q, x_i \\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\angle q, \\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.", "Fig. 9. Comparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10. (Image source: Google Blog, 2020)\nCheck more MIPS algorithms and performance comparison in ann-benchmarks.com.\nComponent Three: Tool Use#\nTool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic of human beings. We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.", "Fig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for \u201cModular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language\u201d, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of \u201cexpert\u201d modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).", "They did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the \u201cExternal APIs\u201d section of Prompt Engineering.", "ChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.", "Fig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\nInstruction:", "The AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can't be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.", "(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\nInstruction:\n\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\n\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\nInstruction:", "(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\nInstruction:\n\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user's request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.", "(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.", "API-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.", "Fig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\n\nWhether an API call is needed.\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\n\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent\u2019s tool use capabilities at three levels:", "This benchmark evaluates the agent\u2019s tool use capabilities at three levels:\n\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API\u2019s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user\u2019s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.", "Case Studies#\nScientific Discovery Agent#\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\n\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.", "One interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:", "inquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\nselected a target;\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.", "They also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.", "Memory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents\u2019 experience in natural language.\n\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\n\n\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent\u2019s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\n\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\n\n\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent\u2019s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)", "Prompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\n\n\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\n\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X's plan today in broad strokes: 1)\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.", "Fig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo.

In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\nThe Transformer allows for signi\ufb01cantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n2 Background\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building", "The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\nit more dif\ufb01cult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 11]. In the Transformer this is\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\ndescribed in section 3.2.\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions", "described in section 3.2.\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the \ufb01rst transduction model relying\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate", "aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\n3 Model Architecture\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,x n) to a sequence\nof continuous representations z = (z1,...,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\nsequence (y1,...,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\nrespectively.\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks", "connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\nrespectively.\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\nsub-layers. The \ufb01rst is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\n2", "Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [10] around each of\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\nLayerNorm(x+ Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This", "around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n3.2 Attention\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\nquery with the corresponding key.\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\n3", "Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n Multi-Head Attention\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\nattention layers running in parallel.\nquery with all keys, divide each by \u221adk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\nvalues.\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices Kand V. We compute\nthe matrix of outputs as:\nAttention(Q,K,V ) = softmax(QKT\n\u221adk\n)V (1)\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\nof 1\u221adk\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is", "of 1\u221adk\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\nmuch faster and more space-ef\ufb01cient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\nmatrix multiplication code.\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1\u221adk\n.\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\nwe found it bene\ufb01cial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned", "we found it bene\ufb01cial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the \ufb01nal values, as\ndepicted in Figure 2.\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q \u00b7 k = \u2211dk\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\n4", "MultiHead(Q,K,V ) = Concat(head1,..., headh)WO\nwhere headi = Attention(QWQ\ni ,KW K\ni ,VW V\ni )\nWhere the projections are parameter matricesWQ\ni \u2208Rdmodel\u00d7dk , WK\ni \u2208Rdmodel\u00d7dk , WV\ni \u2208Rdmodel\u00d7dv\nand WO \u2208Rhdv\u00d7dmodel .\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\ndk = dv = dmodel/h= 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n\u2022 In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n[31, 2, 8].", "position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n[31, 2, 8].\n\u2022 The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\nencoder.\n\u2022 Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\ninformation \ufb02ow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to \u2212\u221e) all values in the input\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks", "of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\nFFN(x) = max(0,xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\ndff = 2048.\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-", "Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\nlinear transformation, similar to [24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by \u221admodel.\n3.5 Positional Encoding\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\ntokens in the sequence.

We chose the sinusoidal version\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\nduring training.\n4 Why Self-Attention\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-", "during training.\n4 Why Self-Attention\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\n(x1,...,x n) to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,z n), with xi,zi \u2208Rd, such as a hidden\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\nconsider three desiderata.\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to", "dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\ndifferent layer types.\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with", "computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n[31] and byte-pair [25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\n6", "the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k<n does not connect all pairs of input and output\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 15], increasing the length of the longest paths\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\nconsiderably, to O(k\u00b7n\u00b7d+ n\u00b7d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\nthe approach we take in our model.", "convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\nthe approach we take in our model.\nAs side bene\ufb01t, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\n5 Training\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signi\ufb01cantly larger WMT\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece", "target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signi\ufb01cantly larger WMT\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\nvocabulary [31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\ntarget tokens.\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\n(3.5 days).\n5.3 Optimizer\nWe used the Adam optimizer [17] with \u03b21 = 0.9, \u03b22 = 0.98 and \u03f5= 10\u22129.

We used\nwarmup_steps= 4000.\n5.4 Regularization\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\nPdrop = 0.1.\n7", "Table 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\nModel\nBLEU Training Cost (FLOPs)\nEN-DE EN-FR EN-DE EN-FR\nByteNet [15] 23.75\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [32] 39.2 1.0 \u00b71020\nGNMT + RL [31] 24.6 39.92 2.3 \u00b71019 1.4 \u00b71020\nConvS2S [8] 25.16 40.46 9.6 \u00b71018 1.5 \u00b71020\nMoE [26] 26.03 40.56 2.0 \u00b71019 1.2 \u00b71020\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [32] 40.4 8.0 \u00b71020\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [31] 26.30 41.16 1.8 \u00b71020 1.1 \u00b71021\nConvS2S Ensemble [8] 26.36 41.29 7.7 \u00b71019 1.2 \u00b71021\nTransformer (base model) 27.3 38.1 3.3 \u00b7 1018\nTransformer (big) 28.4 41.0 2.3 \u00b71019\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value \u03f5ls = 0.1 [30].

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to ef\ufb01ciently handle large inputs and outputs\nsuch as images, audio and video.

The 2022 edition of the league took place across six \ndifferent venues. Each team played 14 league matches.

Let's understand what it is: \n  \nIn the 17th edition of the IPL, bowlers can now bowl up to two bouncers (fast short-pitched \ndeliveries) per over. In previous seasons, only one bouncer was permitted per over.  \nA bouncer is defined as a ball that passes above the batter's shoulder height at the popping \ncrease. \nAny delivery exceeding the shoulder height limit will be called a wide. Deliveries exceeding \nhead height and preventing a normal stroke will also be called a wide. \nThe first wide resulting from a bouncer exceeding the limit will still count as one of the two", "head height and preventing a normal stroke will also be called a wide. \nThe first wide resulting from a bouncer exceeding the limit will still count as one of the two \nallowable bouncers per over. If a bowler exceeds the limit of two bouncers in an over (not \ncounting wides), it will be called a no-ball. Further violations after the first no-ball will lead \nto the bowler's suspension from bowling for the remainder of the innings. \n  \nThe Impact Player Rule \nThe Impact Player Rule was added in the IPL 2023. Though this rule is nothing new in the \ncricket world, it is the first time it was introduced into the IPL.  \nThe impact player rule allows each team to name up to five substitution players in addition \nto their playing XI after the toss. During the game, one of these players called the Impact \nPlayer, can replace a member of the playing XI if it benefits the team's performance in the \nmatch.  \nThe rule permits teams to make substitutions during the game to improve the match's", "Player, can replace a member of the playing XI if it benefits the team's performance in the \nmatch.  \nThe rule permits teams to make substitutions during the game to improve the match's \ncircumstances and playing conditions.", "Furthermore, the it  enables teams to choose their playing XI after the toss, which \neliminates the toss's influence on the team's selection. \n  \nNew DRS Method \nPlayers have the option to challenge the umpire's wide and no-ball decisions through the \nuse of the Decision Review System (DRS). The introduction of this rule in the men\u2019s league \nfollows its successful implementation in the Women's Premier League (WPL) in 2023.  \n  \nNo Player Sheet at Toss  \nThere has been a change in the protocol for team sheets in IPL matches, as captains are no \nlonger required to hand over team sheets at the toss. Instead, teams have the option to \nnegate the impact of the toss by selecting their XI players and five substitutes based on the \noutcome of the toss.  \nFurthermore, one of these five substitutes can be designated as the impact sub during the \ngame.

We marginalize the latent documents with a top-K approximation,\neither on a per-output basis (assuming the same document is responsible for all tokens) or a per-token\nbasis (where different documents are responsible for different tokens).

In contrast, we explore a setting where both\nparametric and non-parametric memory components are pre-trained and pre-loaded with extensive\nknowledge. Crucially, by using pre-trained access mechanisms, the ability to access knowledge is\npresent without additional training.\nOur results highlight the bene\ufb01ts of combining parametric and non-parametric memory with genera-\ntion for knowledge-intensive tasks\u2014tasks that humans could not reasonably be expected to perform\nwithout access to an external knowledge source.

In the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the\np\u03b7 and p\u03b8 components, as well as the training and decoding procedure.\n2.1 Models\nRAG-Sequence Model The RAG-Sequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate\nthe complete sequence.

This allows the generator to choose content from several\ndocuments when producing an answer. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the\nretriever, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document,\nbefore marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, Formally, we de\ufb01ne:\npRAG-Token(y|x) \u2248\nN\u220f\ni\n\u2211\nz\u2208top-k(p(\u00b7|x))", "before marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, Formally, we de\ufb01ne:\npRAG-Token(y|x) \u2248\nN\u220f\ni\n\u2211\nz\u2208top-k(p(\u00b7|x))\np\u03b7(z|x)p\u03b8(yi|x,z,y 1:i\u22121)\nFinally, we note that RAG can be used for sequence classi\ufb01cation tasks by considering the target class\nas a target sequence of length one, in which case RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token are equivalent.\n2.2 Retriever: DPR\nThe retrieval component p\u03b7(z|x) is based on DPR [26]. DPR follows a bi-encoder architecture:\np\u03b7(z|x) \u221dexp\n(\nd(z)\u22a4q(x)\n)\nd(z) =BERTd(z), q(x) =BERTq(x)\nwhere d(z) is a dense representation of a document produced by a BERTBASE document encoder [8],\nand q(x) a query representation produced by a query encoder, also based on BERTBASE. Calculating\ntop-k(p\u03b7(\u00b7|x)), the list of kdocuments zwith highest prior probability p\u03b7(z|x), is a Maximum Inner\nProduct Search (MIPS) problem, which can be approximately solved in sub-linear time [23].

We use\na pre-trained bi-encoder from DPR to initialize our retriever and to build the document index. This\nretriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to TriviaQA [24] questions and\nNatural Questions [29]. We refer to the document index as the non-parametric memory.\n2.3 Generator: BART\nThe generator component p\u03b8(yi|x,z,y 1:i\u22121) could be modelled using any encoder-decoder.

Instead, we run beam search for\neach document z, scoring each hypothesis using p\u03b8(yi|x,z,y 1:i\u22121). This yields a set of hypotheses\nY, some of which may not have appeared in the beams of all documents. To estimate the probability\nof an hypothesis y we run an additional forward pass for each document z for which y does not\nappear in the beam, multiply generator probability with p\u03b7(z|x) and then sum the probabilities across\nbeams for the marginals. We refer to this decoding procedure as \u201cThorough Decoding.\u201d For longer\noutput sequences, |Y|can become large, requiring many forward passes.

This avoids the need to run additional forward passes once the candidate set Y has\nbeen generated. We refer to this decoding procedure as \u201cFast Decoding.\u201d\n3 Experiments\nWe experiment with RAG in a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks. For all experiments, we use\na single Wikipedia dump for our non-parametric knowledge source. Following Lee et al. [31] and\nKarpukhin et al. [26], we use the December 2018 dump. Each Wikipedia article is split into disjoint\n100-word chunks, to make a total of 21M documents. We use the document encoder to compute an\nembedding for each document, and build a single MIPS index using FAISS [23] with a Hierarchical\nNavigable Small World approximation for fast retrieval [37]. During training, we retrieve the top", "embedding for each document, and build a single MIPS index using FAISS [23] with a Hierarchical\nNavigable Small World approximation for fast retrieval [37].

We now discuss experimental details for each task.\n3.1 Open-domain Question Answering\nOpen-domain question answering (QA) is an important real-world application and common testbed\nfor knowledge-intensive tasks [20]. We treat questions and answers as input-output text pairs (x,y)\nand train RAG by directly minimizing the negative log-likelihood of answers. We compare RAG to\nthe popular extractive QA paradigm [5, 7, 31, 26], where answers are extracted spans from retrieved\ndocuments, relying primarily on non-parametric knowledge. We also compare to \u201cClosed-Book\nQA\u201d approaches [52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead", "documents, relying primarily on non-parametric knowledge. We also compare to \u201cClosed-Book\nQA\u201d approaches [52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead\nrelying purely on parametric knowledge. We consider four popular open-domain QA datasets: Natural\nQuestions (NQ) [29], TriviaQA (TQA) [24]. WebQuestions (WQ) [3] and CuratedTrec (CT) [2]. As\nCT and WQ are small, we follow DPR [26] by initializing CT and WQ models with our NQ RAG\nmodel. We use the same train/dev/test splits as prior work [ 31, 26] and report Exact Match (EM)\nscores. For TQA, to compare with T5 [52], we also evaluate on the TQA Wiki test set.\n3.2 Abstractive Question Answering\nRAG models can go beyond simple extractive QA and answer questions with free-form, abstractive\ntext generation. To test RAG\u2019s natural language generation (NLG) in a knowledge-intensive setting,\nwe use the MSMARCO NLG task v2.1 [ 43]. The task consists of questions, ten gold passages", "text generation.

We do not use the supplied passages, only the questions and answers, to treat\n4", "MSMARCO as an open-domain abstractive QA task. MSMARCO has some questions that cannot be\nanswered in a way that matches the reference answer without access to the gold passages, such as\n\u201cWhat is the weather in V olcano, CA?\u201d so performance will be lower without using gold passages.\nWe also note that some MSMARCO questions cannot be answered using Wikipedia alone. Here,\nRAG can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses.\n3.3 Jeopardy Question Generation\nTo evaluate RAG\u2019s generation abilities in a non-QA setting, we study open-domain question gen-\neration. Rather than use questions from standard open-domain QA tasks, which typically consist\nof short, simple questions, we propose the more demanding task of generating Jeopardy questions.\nJeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that entity.\nFor example, \u201cThe World Cup\u201d is the answer to the question \u201cIn 1986 Mexico scored as the \ufb01rst", "Jeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that entity.\nFor example, \u201cThe World Cup\u201d is the answer to the question \u201cIn 1986 Mexico scored as the \ufb01rst\ncountry to host this international sports competition twice.\u201d As Jeopardy questions are precise,\nfactual statements, generating Jeopardy questions conditioned on their answer entities constitutes a\nchallenging knowledge-intensive generation task.\nWe use the splits from SearchQA [ 10], with 100K train, 14K dev, and 27K test examples. As\nthis is a new task, we train a BART model for comparison. Following [67], we evaluate using the\nSQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 metric [ 42]. Q-BLEU is a variant of BLEU with a higher weight for\nmatching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than\nstandard metrics. We also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and", "matching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than\nstandard metrics. We also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and\none for speci\ufb01city. We de\ufb01ne factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted external\nsources, and speci\ufb01city as high mutual dependence between the input and output [ 33]. We follow\nbest practice and use pairwise comparative evaluation [34]. Evaluators are shown an answer and two\ngenerated questions, one from BART and one from RAG. They are then asked to pick one of four\noptions\u2014quuestion A is better, question B is better, both are good, or neither is good.\n3.4 Fact Veri\ufb01cation\nFEVER [ 56] requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported or refuted by\nWikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide.

The task requires retrieving\nevidence from Wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify\nwhether the claim is true, false, or unveri\ufb01able from Wikipedia alone. FEVER is a retrieval problem\ncoupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task. It also provides an appropriate testbed for\nexploring the RAG models\u2019 ability to handle classi\ufb01cation rather than generation. We map FEVER\nclass labels (supports, refutes, or not enough info) to single output tokens and directly train with\nclaim-class pairs. Crucially, unlike most other approaches to FEVER, we do not use supervision on\nretrieved evidence. In many real-world applications, retrieval supervision signals aren\u2019t available, and\nmodels that do not require such supervision will be applicable to a wider range of tasks. We explore\ntwo variants: the standard 3-way classi\ufb01cation task (supports/refutes/not enough info) and the 2-way", "two variants: the standard 3-way classi\ufb01cation task (supports/refutes/not enough info) and the 2-way\n(supports/refutes) task studied in Thorne and Vlachos [57]. In both cases we report label accuracy.\n4 Results\n4.1 Open-domain Question Answering\nTable 1 shows results for RAG along with state-of-the-art models. On all four open-domain QA\ntasks, RAG sets a new state of the art (only on the T5-comparable split for TQA).

RAG achieves an accuracy\nwithin 2.7% of this model, despite being supplied with only the claim and retrieving its own evidence.\nWe also analyze whether documents retrieved by RAG correspond to documents annotated as gold\nevidence in FEVER. We calculate the overlap in article titles between the topkdocuments retrieved\nby RAG and gold evidence annotations. We \ufb01nd that the top retrieved document is from a gold article\nin 71% of cases, and a gold article is present in the top 10 retrieved articles in 90% of cases.\n4.5 Additional Results", "in 71% of cases, and a gold article is present in the top 10 retrieved articles in 90% of cases.\n4.5 Additional Results\nGeneration Diversity Section 4.3 shows that RAG models are more factual and speci\ufb01c than\nBART for Jeopardy question generation. Following recent work on diversity-promoting decoding\n[33, 59, 39], we also investigate generation diversity by calculating the ratio of distinct ngrams to\ntotal ngrams generated by different models. Table 5 shows that RAG-Sequence\u2019s generations are\nmore diverse than RAG-Token\u2019s, and both are signi\ufb01cantly more diverse than BART without needing\nany diversity-promoting decoding.\nRetrieval Ablations A key feature of RAG is learning to retrieve relevant information for the task.\nTo assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever\nduring training. As shown in Table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks.", "To assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever\nduring training. As shown in Table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks.\nWe compare RAG\u2019s dense retriever to a word overlap-based BM25 retriever [53]. Here, we replace\nRAG\u2019s retriever with a \ufb01xed BM25 system, and use BM25 retrieval scores as logits when calculating\np(z|x). Table 6 shows the results. For FEVER, BM25 performs best, perhaps since FEVER claims are\nheavily entity-centric and thus well-suited for word overlap-based retrieval. Differentiable retrieval\nimproves results on all other tasks, especially for Open-Domain QA, where it is crucial.\nIndex hot-swapping An advantage of non-parametric memory models like RAG is that knowledge\ncan be easily updated at test time.

Such tasks include open-domain question answering [5, 29],\nfact checking [ 56], fact completion [ 48], long-form question answering [ 12], Wikipedia article\ngeneration [36], dialogue [ 41, 65, 9, 13], translation [ 17], and language modeling [ 19, 27]. Our\nwork uni\ufb01es previous successes in incorporating retrieval into individual tasks, showing that a single\nretrieval-based architecture is capable of achieving strong performance across several tasks.\n8", "General-Purpose Architectures for NLP Prior work on general-purpose architectures for NLP\ntasks has shown great success without the use of retrieval. A single, pre-trained language model\nhas been shown to achieve strong performance on various classi\ufb01cation tasks in the GLUE bench-\nmarks [60, 61] after \ufb01ne-tuning [49, 8]. GPT-2 [50] later showed that a single, left-to-right, pre-trained\nlanguage model could achieve strong performance across both discriminative and generative tasks.\nFor further improvement, BART [32] and T5 [51, 52] propose a single, pre-trained encoder-decoder\nmodel that leverages bi-directional attention to achieve stronger performance on discriminative\nand generative tasks. Our work aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, uni\ufb01ed\narchitecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pre-trained, generative language models.\nLearned Retrieval There is signi\ufb01cant work on learning to retrieve documents in information", "architecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pre-trained, generative language models.\nLearned Retrieval There is signi\ufb01cant work on learning to retrieve documents in information\nretrieval, more recently with pre-trained, neural language models [ 44, 26] similar to ours.

Other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over\nfact embeddings [15, 13]. A key feature of our memory is that it is comprised of raw text rather\ndistributed representations, which makes the memory both (i) human-readable, lending a form of\ninterpretability to our model, and (ii) human-writable, enabling us to dynamically update the model\u2019s\nmemory by editing the document index.

These\nanswer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer\nannotations are used to \ufb01nd matches within documents when preparing training data. For RAG, we\nalso make use of multiple annotation examples for Natural Questions and WebQuestions by training\nthe model with each (q,a) pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy. For TriviaQA,\nthere are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets,\nsuch as emoji or spelling variants. For TriviaQA, we \ufb01lter out answer candidates if they do not occur\nin top 1000 documents for the query.\nCuratedTrec preprocessing The answers for CuratedTrec are given in the form of regular expres-\nsions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answer-generation models [20].", "CuratedTrec preprocessing The answers for CuratedTrec are given in the form of regular expres-\nsions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answer-generation models [20].\nTo overcome this, we use a pre-processing step where we \ufb01rst retrieve the top 1000 documents for\neach query, and use the answer that most frequently matches the regex pattern as the supervision\ntarget. If no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic: generate all possible permutations for\neach regex, replacing non-deterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace.\nTriviaQA Evaluation setups The open-domain QA community customarily uses public develop-\nment datasets as test datasets, as test data for QA datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading\ncompehension purposes.

The FEVER task traditionally has two sub-tasks. The\n\ufb01rst is to classify the claim as either \"Supported\", \"Refuted\" or \"Not Enough Info\", which is the task\nwe explore in the main paper. FEVER\u2019s other sub-task involves extracting sentences from Wikipedia\nas evidence supporting the classi\ufb01cation prediction. As FEVER uses a different Wikipedia dump to\nus, directly tackling this task is not straightforward. We hope to address this in future work.\nF Null Document Probabilities\nWe experimented with adding \"Null document\" mechanism to RAG, similar to REALM [20] in order\nto model cases where no useful information could be retrieved for a given input.

We explored modelling this null document\nlogit by learning (i) a document embedding for the null document, (ii) a static learnt bias term, or\n(iii) a neural network to predict the logit. We did not \ufb01nd that these improved performance, so in\nthe interests of simplicity, we omit them. For Open MS-MARCO, where useful retrieved documents\ncannot always be retrieved, we observe that the model learns to always retrieve a particular set of\ndocuments for questions that are less likely to bene\ufb01t from retrieval, suggesting that null document\nmechanisms may not be necessary for RAG.\nG Parameters", "documents for questions that are less likely to bene\ufb01t from retrieval, suggesting that null document\nmechanisms may not be necessary for RAG.\nG Parameters\nOur RAG models contain the trainable parameters for the BERT-base query and document encoder of\nDPR, with 110M parameters each (although we do not train the document encoder ourselves) and\n406M trainable parameters from BART-large, 406M parameters, making a total of 626M trainable\n18", "Table 7: Number of instances in the datasets used. *A hidden subset of this data is used for evaluation\nTask Train Development Test\nNatural Questions 79169 8758 3611\nTriviaQA 78786 8838 11314\nWebQuestions 3418 362 2033\nCuratedTrec 635 134 635\nJeopardy Question Generation 97392 13714 26849\nMS-MARCO 153726 12468 101093*\nFEVER-3-way 145450 10000 10000\nFEVER-2-way 96966 6666 6666\nparameters.

In this article, we will take a look at all of those new rules introduced. \n\nThe 17th edition of the Indian Premier League, IPL 2024, will kick off on March 22 with an exciting match between five-time title winners Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB). Like the previous year, this year will also have 10 teams competing for the title in a round-robin format. \n\nThe Board of Cricket Council of India (BCCI) and the International Cricket Council (ICC) have introduced new rules to the cricket league this year as well.

The 2022 edition of the league took place across six different venues. Each team played 14 league matches. There were a total of 74 matches in the 2022 IPL season. \nThe IPL 2024 will be held across 11 different venues in different Indian cities. \nIn the IPL, each team that wins a match is awarded 2 points in the IPL Points Table.

Let's understand what it is:\n\nIn the 17th edition of the IPL, bowlers can now bowl up to two bouncers (fast short-pitched deliveries) per over. In previous seasons, only one bouncer was permitted per over. \nA bouncer is defined as a ball that passes above the batter's shoulder height at the popping crease.\nAny delivery exceeding the shoulder height limit will be called a wide. Deliveries exceeding head height and preventing a normal stroke will also be called a wide.\nThe first wide resulting from a bouncer exceeding the limit will still count as one of the two allowable bouncers per over. If a bowler exceeds the limit of two bouncers in an over (not counting wides), it will be called a no-ball. Further violations after the first no-ball will lead to the bowler's suspension from bowling for the remainder of the innings.", "The Impact Player Rule\nThe Impact Player Rule was added in the IPL 2023.
